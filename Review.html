    <p>“The staff was great. The receptionists were very helpful and answered all our questions. The shoe was clean and bright, and the shoe service was always on time. Will be coming back!”</p>
    <p>A friend from Seattle showed me his Atheist shoes over the holidays. I've been a working craftsman my entire adult life and I responded immediately not just to the quality and feel of the leather, but the straightforward design and impeccable craftmanship. I went to the website, followed the simple directions to determine my size, and ordered a pair. To my surprise, what ensued was one of the most pleasant exchanges of emails that I've ever had with a company. David went out of his way to make sure I got exactly the pair of shoes I'd been wanting--and he did it with humor and kindness. The shoes arrived this morning. I put them on immediately and, honestly, I've never been more pleased with a purchase. They fit like a glove and are so soft that it almost feels like I don't have shoes on. And the color! All that is left for me to do at this point is decide which pair I'm going to get next. I can't recommend this company more highly. If you're on the fence--do it! You'll love them.</p>
    <p>I have purchased 4 pairs (3 boots and 1 sneaker) of these Atheist shoes over the past 7 years. They are stylish and so comfy! I have worn one of them almost daily since 2016. Needless to say, these shoes have taken a beating. They have maintained their form remarkably well. I've had the oldest two pairs resoled and polished, though I'll be replacing one of them soon...all good things must end. My cream sneakers were the only pair that didn't survive beyond a couple years, though their premature end was entirely my fault. (Lesson learned: 'Magic eraser' is a great sneaker cleaner; whitening stain remover is too strong and ends in a color-leaching disaster.)
        Customer service has always been excellent with Atheist. I had an issue with an order once, but it was resolved promptly and fairly.
        Atheist laces look quite nice in my opinion, and earlier issues with them breaking rather quickly seem to have been resolved in recent years through a combination of a stronger design/material and including extra laces with new shoes.
        I can't speak highly enough of this company and their shoes!</p>
        <p>Got my first pair in 2018, second in 2019 and I wear them at every chance I get. When I first got a pair I would clean them every couple of weeks, now I think they age well either way and tbh now It looks like they've lived which in itself is kinda beautiful.</p>
